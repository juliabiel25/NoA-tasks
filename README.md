# Task 2

For the second task, I'd like to present two of my react projects listed below. 

As a preface I'd like to say that even though I do think one of them is more robust - it is not perfect by any means and there surely are things I would change, 
were I to pick it back up right now.

## [The fake store app](https://github.com/juliabiel25/fake-store) 
This is the more polished app I'd like to present, although the idea behind it is rather simple.
In it's core design, it is a simple API data fetching app - information about products are fetched from an [API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) endpoint and are then displayed on the main page.
The products can be viewed in more detail on a separate page view, filtered by their respective categories and added or remove to/from cart.
It's a single page application using a react router for page navigation purposes.

### The good
- the project accounts for long API response time with loading animations
- responsive design
- 

### The bad
- the project is not using typescript - something I now deem to be very helpful and would likely make the project more scalable.
